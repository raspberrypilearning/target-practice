If you are following the [Introduction to Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/python-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Rocket launch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rocket-launch) project. In this project, you will make an interactive animation of a rocket launching a satellite into orbit.

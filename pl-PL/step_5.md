## What colour did you hit?

Next, you will add some code to get the colour at the location of the arrow.

### Get the colour hit by the arrow

--- task ---

Add a new **global variable** called `hit_colour`.

Add code to `get` the colour at the centre of the arrow ,and store it in the `hit_colour` variable.


--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 9
line_highlights: 10, 13, 14
---
def shoot_arrow(): global hit_colour  
arrow_x = randint(100, 300)  
arrow_y = randint(100, 300) hit_colour = get(arrow_x, arrow_y).hex print(hit_colour) fill('brown') circle(arrow_x, arrow_y, 15)

--- /code ---

**Tip:** The code to `get` the colour needs to be **before** the code to draw the `circle` otherwise you will always save the brown colour of the arrow!

--- task ---

**Test:** Click the **Run** button. You should see colours being printed in the **Text output**, in hexadecimal format.

--- /task ---

### Run code when the mouse is pressed

--- task ---

Comment out the line that prints the colour. This means it will not run.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 13
line_highlights: 14
---

    hit_colour = get(arrow_x, arrow_y).hex
    # print(hit_colour)
    circle(arrow_x, arrow_y, 15)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add code to print the target emoji ðŸŽ¯ **when the mouse is clicked**.

--- code ---
---
language: python line_numbers: true line_number_start: 5
line_highlights: 6-7
---
# Tutaj pojawi siÄ™ funkcja Mouse_pressed
def mouse_pressed():    
print('ðŸŽ¯')

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Click the **Run** button. You should see the ðŸŽ¯ character printed when you click the mouse on the target.

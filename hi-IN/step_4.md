## अपने तीर को चलाये

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
When you click or tap, an arrow will fire at the position of a moving target circle.

### Draw a target circle every frame

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> Computers create the effect of movement by showing lots of images one after another. Each image is called a <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> frame </span>.   
</p>

--- task ---

Define your `shoot_arrow()` function under the comment **# The shoot_arrow function goes here**.

Add code to randomly draw a brown circle within a target area:

![A rectangle showing the target area coordinates in a semi transparent rectangle. The target area is between x=100 and y=100 to x=300 and y=300 so covers the whole target and wider.](images/target_area.png)

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py — shoot_arrow() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 7
line_highlights: 8-12
---
# shoot_arrow फ़ंक्शन यहाँ जाता है
def shoot_arrow():   
arrow_x = randint(100, 300)  # Store a random number between 100 and 300    
arrow_y = randint(100, 300)  # Store a random number between 100 and 300    
fill('sienna')  # Set the arrow to fill colour to brown   
circle(arrow_x, arrow_y, 15)  # Draw a small circle at random coordinates

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Go to the `draw` function and call your new `shoot_arrow` function.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py — draw() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 31
line_highlights: 33
---

    fill('yellow')  # Set the colour for the circle fill to yellow      
    circle(200, 200, 30)  # Draw the middle circle using x, y, width
    shoot_arrow()

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** 🔄 Run your code and see the arrow appear in a random position each frame.

The background and target will be drawn over the old arrow. This means you only see one arrow at a time.

--- /task ---

### Get the colour hit by the arrow

The `get()` function returns the colour of a pixel.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;">pixel</span>, short for picture element, is a single coloured dot within an image. Images are made up of lots of coloured pixels.
</p>

--- task ---

Add a **global variable** called `hit_colour` that can be used throughout your code.

Add code to `get` the colour of the pixel at the centre of the arrow and store it in the `hit_colour` variable. In order to compare the colours, we need to use the hexadecimal code this can be done with the `.hex` string.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py — shoot_arrow() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 7
line_highlights: 8, 11
---
# The shoot_arrow function goes here
def shoot_arrow(): global hit_colour  # Can be used in other functions  
arrow_x = randint(100, 300)  # Store a random number between 100 and 300    
arrow_y = randint(100, 300)  # Store a random number between 100 and 300 hit_colour = get(arrow_x, arrow_y).hex  # Get the hit colour     
fill('sienna')  # Set the arrow to fill colour to brown   
circle(arrow_x, arrow_y, 15)  # Draw a small circle at random coordinates

--- /code ---

**Tip:** 💡 The code to `get` the colour needs to be **before** the code to draw the `circle` otherwise you will always save the wood colour of the arrow!

--- /task ---

### Print the colour when the mouse is pressed

The `p5` library 'listens' for certain events, one of these is the press of the mouse button. When it detects that the button has been pressed, it will run whatever code it has been given in the `mouse_pressed` function.

--- task ---

Define your `mouse_pressed()` function under the comment **# The mouse_pressed function goes here**.

Add code to print the target emoji 🎯 when the mouse is clicked.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - mouse_pressed() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 5
line_highlights: 6
---

# The mouse_pressed function goes here
def mouse_pressed():    
print('🎯')

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** 🔄 Run your project.

The project prints 🎯 each time the arrow is redrawn.

**Debug:** 🐞 If you are seeing a message about `hit_colour` being 'not defined', then go back to `shoot_arrow()` and check that you have included the `global hit_colour` line.

**Debug:** 🐞 Check the `print` line really carefully for commas and brackets.

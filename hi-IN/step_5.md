## अंक स्कोर करें

Your game will add scores based on where the arrow hits.

Go to the `draw()` function and add `, outer, inner, middle` to the list of global variables.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: true line_number_start: 26
line_highlights: 28
---

def draw():
# हर फ्रेम में करने के लिए चीजें
  global wood, outer, inner, middle    
sky = color(92, 204, 206) # Red = 92, Green = 204, Blue = 206    
grass = color(149, 212, 122)    
wood = color(145, 96, 51)    
outer = color(0, 120, 180)    
inner = color(210, 60, 60)   
middle = color(220, 200, 0)

हम निर्णय लेने के लिए हर समय <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;">कंडीशन्स</span> का उपयोग करते हैं। हम कह सकते हैं 'अगर पेंसिल को कुंद कर दिया जाए, तो उसे तेज कर दें'। Similarly, `if` conditions let us write code that do something different depending on whether a condition is true or false.

### Display the scores

--- task ---

Delete ❌ the `print( red(hit_color), green(hit_color), blue(hit_color) )` line of code.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - mouse_pressed() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 7
line_highlights: 9
---
# mouse_pressed फ़ंक्शन यहाँ जाता है
def mouse_pressed():


--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

`print` a message `if` the `hit_color` is equal to `outer` 🎯.

Notice 👀 that the code uses two equals signs `==` to mean **equal to**.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - mouse_pressed() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 7
line_highlights: 9, 10
---

# The mouse_pressed function goes here
def mouse_pressed():     
if hit_color == outer:      
print('You hit the outer circle, 50 points!') # Like functions, 'if' statements are indented

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** 🔄 Run your project. Try to stop the arrow on the blue outer circle to see your message.

**Tip:** 💡 `frame_rate()`, in `setup`, controls how fast your game draws. If it's going too fast, set it to a lower number.

**Debug:** 🐞 Make sure your code matches exactly and you indented the code inside your `if` statement.

--- /task ---

`elif` (else - if) can be used to add more conditions to your `if` statement. These will be read from top to bottom. As soon as a **True** condition is found, it will be actioned. The remaining conditions will be ignored.

--- task ---

Score points if the arrow lands on the `inner` or `middle` circles 🎯:

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - mouse_pressed() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 8
line_highlights: 11, 12, 13, 14
---

def mouse_pressed():    
if hit_color == outer:    
print('You hit the outer circle, 50 points!')    
elif hit_color == inner:    
print('You hit the inner circle, 200 points!')   
elif hit_color == middle:    
print('You hit the middle, 500 points!')

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** 🔄 Run your project. Try to stop the arrow on the inner and middle circles to see their messages.

![The output area with arrow touching the inner circle. The points print statement appears in the output area.](images/yellow-points.png)

**Debug:** 🐞 Check your indentation matches the example.

**Debug:** 🐞 If you see a message about `inner` or `middle` being 'not defined', then go back to `draw()` and check that they are on the line that declares variables global.

--- /task ---

### Missing the target

There is one more decision you need to make: what happens if the arrow does not land on any of the target circles? ❌

To do this last check, you use `else`.

--- task ---

Add code to `print` a message `else` none of the `if` and `elif` statements have been met.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py line_numbers: true line_number_start: 8
line_highlights: 15, 16
---

def mouse_pressed():    
if hit_color == outer:   
print('You hit the outer circle, 50 points!')   
elif hit_color == inner:   
print('You hit the inner circle, 200 points!')   
elif hit_color == middle:    
print('You hit the middle, 500 points!')   
else:   
print('You missed! No points!')

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** 🔄 Run your project. Try to stop the arrow in the grass or sky to see the miss message.

**Choose:** 💭 Change the number of points scored for the different colours if you like.
